# CI Pipeline Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline monitoring system that captures actual status programmatically using `gh` CLI commands and native tools aligned with the project's architecture.

## Priority Status

**Priority**: High - Next immediate task after dependency automation completion  
**Justification**: With 11 packages and complex automation running every 30 minutes (Renovate) plus repository dispatch events, we need proactive monitoring to ensure system reliability and catch issues before they cascade.

## Key Monitoring Events

### 1. Renovate-Triggered Events (Every 30 minutes)
- PR creation for dependency updates
- Automerge attempts (success/failure)
- Merge conflict detection
- API rate limit approaching
- Security vulnerability patches (Priority 10)

### 2. Package Publishing Events
- `repository_dispatch: package-published` from all 11 packages
- Tag pushes matching `@chasenocap/*@*`
- Manual workflow dispatch for publishing
- Cross-repository communication health via PAT_TOKEN

### 3. Dependency Update Workflow Events
- Scheduled runs (every 6 hours)
- Repository dispatch triggers
- PR creation from auto-update-dependencies
- Submodule sync status

### 4. Build and Test Events
- CI workflow failures in any of the 11 packages
- Test failures blocking automerge
- Coverage drops below 90% threshold
- Build failures in meta repository

### 5. Manual Intervention Indicators
- Frequency of manual workflow dispatches
- Manual PR merges (indicating automerge failures)
- `[skip ci]` commit frequency
- Direct commits to main branch

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Monitoring Script: `scripts/monitor-ci-health.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Real-time CI health monitoring using gh CLI

# Features:
# - Check workflow status across all repositories
# - Monitor PR queue depth and age
# - Track automerge success rates
# - Detect stuck PRs and failed workflows
# - Calculate automation effectiveness score
# - Generate JSON output for programmatic consumption
```

Key `gh` commands to use:
- `gh workflow list --repo ChaseNoCap/[package]`
- `gh run list --workflow [workflow-name] --limit 10`
- `gh pr list --label dependencies --json state,createdAt,mergeable`
- `gh api repos/ChaseNoCap/[repo]/actions/runs`
- `gh api rate_limit` (monitor API usage)

### 2. Health Check Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-health-check.yml`

Triggers on:
- `schedule: '*/30 * * * *'` (align with Renovate)
- `workflow_run` completion events
- `repository_dispatch: [dependency-updated, package-published]`
- Manual dispatch for on-demand checks

Actions:
- Run monitor-ci-health.sh
- Generate dashboard markdown
- Create issues for failures
- Update status badges
- Send notifications if critical

### 3. Dashboard Generator: `scripts/generate-ci-dashboard.sh`

Generates `/docs/ci-dashboard.md` with:
- Overall system health score
- Per-package CI status table
- Recent failures and resolutions
- PR velocity metrics
- Automation effectiveness trends
- Security vulnerability status

### 4. Monitoring Documentation: `docs/ci-monitoring-guide.md`

Contents:
- How to use monitoring tools
- Understanding dashboard metrics
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Setting up notifications
- Performance optimization tips
- Emergency response procedures

## Metrics to Capture

### Performance Metrics
- Time from package publish to PR creation
- Workflow execution duration trends
- Queue depth over time
- API rate limit consumption

### Reliability Metrics
- Success/failure rates by workflow
- Automerge success percentage
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Cascading failure frequency

### Automation Effectiveness
- Manual intervention frequency
- Percentage of automated vs manual merges
- Time saved through automation
- Security patch deployment speed

## Integration Points

### 1. GitHub Notifications Integration
- Use `https://github.com/notifications` API
- Filter for workflow failures
- Track response times

### 2. Renovate Dashboard Integration
- Monitor `.github/DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD.md`
- Track pending updates
- Detect configuration issues

### 3. Package Registry Health
- Monitor GitHub Packages availability
- Track publish success rates
- Detect authentication issues

## Success Criteria

1. **Visibility**: Single command shows health of entire CI/CD pipeline
2. **Proactive**: Detect issues before they cause failures
3. **Actionable**: Clear guidance on resolving detected issues
4. **Automated**: Minimal manual intervention required
5. **Performance**: Monitoring adds <5% overhead to workflows

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Scripts (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Implement monitor-ci-health.sh with gh commands
- [ ] Create basic dashboard generator
- [ ] Test across all 11 packages

### Phase 2: Automation (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Create ci-health-check.yml workflow
- [ ] Integrate with existing workflows
- [ ] Set up issue creation for failures

### Phase 3: Documentation & Polish (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Write comprehensive monitoring guide
- [ ] Add example dashboards
- [ ] Create troubleshooting runbooks

## Example Dashboard Output

```markdown
# CI Pipeline Health Dashboard

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-26 10:30:00 EST  
**Overall Health**: 🟢 Healthy (95%)

## Package Status

| Package | CI Status | Last Publish | Open PRs | Automerge |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| logger | ✅ Passing | 2h ago | 0 | ✅ |
| cache | ✅ Passing | 1d ago | 1 | ⏳ |
| di-framework | ❌ Failing | 3d ago | 2 | ❌ |

## Recent Issues
- **di-framework**: Test failure in Node 16.x (investigating)
- **API Rate Limit**: 78% consumed (reset in 42 minutes)

## Automation Metrics
- **PR Velocity**: 15 PRs/day (↑ 25% from last week)
- **Automerge Success**: 89% (target: 95%)
- **Manual Interventions**: 3 this week (↓ from 8)
```

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan and provide feedback
2. Begin implementation starting with core monitoring script
3. Test with current Renovate schedule
4. Iterate based on findings
