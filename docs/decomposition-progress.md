## 📋 Remaining Packages (3/8)

Per [Migration Plan](./migration-plan.md), in priority order:

### 1. events (Next Priority)
- **Rationale**: Enable decoupling between contexts
- **Estimated Size**: ~200 lines
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Timeline**: Week 4

### 2. cache
- **Rationale**: Shared caching with decorators
- **Estimated Size**: ~400 lines
- **Dependencies**: events
- **Timeline**: Week 5

### 3. core (Consider splitting/eliminating)
- **Rationale**: May be too generic
- **Alternative**: Distribute to specific packages
- **Decision Required**: Review after other packages

## 🔑 Key Patterns Established

### 1. Documentation-First Development
- Write CLAUDE.md before implementation
- Define context boundaries upfront
- Create README with examples

### 2. Size Control Through Focus
- Single responsibility = naturally small
- <500 lines achieved easily
- No forced splitting needed

### 3. Minimal Public API
- 3-4 exports per package maximum
- One main interface per package
- Hide implementation details

### 4. Clear Dependency Direction
```
app → feature packages → utility packages → infrastructure
         ↓                    ↓                ↓
    report        file-system   logger
                       cache         events
```

### 5. Test Coverage Standards
- 95%+ for utility packages
- 90%+ for feature packages
- Tests in same package

## 📊 Metrics Dashboard

| Package | Status | Size | Coverage | Exports | Dependencies |
|---------|--------|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| test-mocks | ✅ | 400 | 100% | 3 | 1 |
| test-helpers | ✅ | 500 | 91.89% | 4 | 3 |
| di-framework | ✅ | 689 | 84% | 15 | 2 |
| logger | ✅ | 300 | 95%+ | 3 | 0 |
| file-system | ✅ | 400 | 95%+ | 4 | 0 |
| events | ⏳ | ~200 | - | - | 0 |
| cache | ⏳ | ~400 | - | - | 1 |

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Start Events Package (Next Priority)
- [ ] Create package structure
- [ ] Copy CLAUDE.md template
- [ ] Define event interfaces (IEventBus, IDomainEvent)
- [ ] Implement synchronous event bus
- [ ] Add async event support
- [ ] Create event handler decorator
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Document event patterns

### 2. Continue with Cache Package
- [ ] Build on events for invalidation
- [ ] Extract cache decorators from markdown-compiler
- [ ] Implement memory cache with strategies
- [ ] Add Redis support (future)

### 3. Complete Decomposition
- Follow [Migration Plan](./migration-plan.md)
- Use [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)
- Apply [Decomposition Principles](./decomposition-principles.md)

## 🚦 Success Indicators

### ✅ What's Working
- Package sizes naturally small (<500 lines)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Documentation-first approach
- Single responsibility focus

### ⚠️ Areas to Watch
- Test coverage for test-helpers
- Integration complexity
- Maintaining momentum
- Avoiding over-engineering

### 🚫 What to Avoid
- Generic package names (core, utils)
- Circular dependencies
- Premature abstraction
- Breaking existing functionality

## 📅 Projected Timeline

Based on current progress:

- **Week 0** (Complete): Test packages ✅
- **Week 1** (Complete): DI framework package ✅
- **Week 2** (Complete): Logger package + integration ✅
- **Week 3** (Complete): File system package ✅
- **Week 4** (Current): Events package
- **Week 5**: Cache package
- **Week 6**: Final integration & cleanup

Total: 6 weeks to complete decomposition (62.5% complete)

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Lessons Learned
1. Start with highest value/lowest risk packages
2. Documentation-first prevents scope creep
3. Small packages are easier to test
4. Clear names eliminate confusion
5. Integration takes longer than implementation

### Process Improvements
1. Create integration tests before extracting
2. Update imports incrementally
3. Keep old code until new code is proven
4. Document decisions in CLAUDE.md files

## 📝 Decision Log

### May 2025: Test Packages First
- **Decision**: Start with testing packages
- **Rationale**: Foundation for all other packages
- **Outcome**: Success - clean implementation

### May 2025: Two Test Packages
- **Decision**: Split into test-mocks and test-helpers
- **Rationale**: Single responsibility principle
- **Outcome**: Success - clear separation

### May 2025: DI Framework Next
- **Decision**: Extract DI framework before logger
- **Rationale**: Foundation for other packages, enables better testing
- **Outcome**: Success - clean implementation at 689 lines

### January 2025: Logger Package
- **Decision**: Extract to GitHub Packages as @chasenogap/logger
- **Rationale**: High code duplication, clear boundaries
- **Outcome**: Success - 300 lines, fully integrated

### January 2025: File System Package
- **Decision**: Create comprehensive file operations abstraction
- **Rationale**: Centralize file handling, improve error handling
- **Outcome**: Success - 400 lines with excellent error types

### Pending: core Package
- **Question**: Is "core" too generic?
- **Options**: Split into specific packages or eliminate
- **Decision**: Defer until other packages complete

## 🎓 Guidance for Developers

### When Creating New Packages
1. **Check Size**: Aim for <500 lines
2. **Check Name**: Does it explain the purpose?
3. **Check Deps**: Are there 3 or fewer?
4. **Check API**: Are there 5 or fewer exports?
5. **Check Tests**: Can it be tested alone?

### When Integrating Packages
1. **Update Gradually**: One import at a time
2. **Test Continuously**: Run tests after each change
3. **Keep Backups**: Don't delete old code immediately
4. **Document Issues**: Update CLAUDE.md with findings

## 🎓 Key Learnings from File System Package

### 1. Error Handling Excellence
- Created comprehensive error types (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, etc.)
- Each error includes context (path, operation, original error)
- Makes debugging and testing much easier

### 2. Interface Design Patterns
- Async-first API design
- Options objects for extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns (read/write/directory operations)

### 3. Testing Strategies
- Mock implementations proved invaluable
- Error case testing as important as happy path
- Directory fixtures simplified integration tests

### 4. Size Control Success
- Started targeting ~300 lines, ended at ~400
- Extra 100 lines went to comprehensive error handling
- Worth the trade-off for better developer experience

### 5. Documentation Value
- CLAUDE.md file helped maintain focus
- Clear context boundaries prevented scope creep
- Usage examples in README drove API design
