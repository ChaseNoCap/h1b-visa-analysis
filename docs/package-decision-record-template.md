**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded]  
**Package(s):** [Package name(s) affected]

## Decision

[One sentence summary of the decision being made]

## Context

[Brief description of the current situation that prompted this decision]

## Decision Type

- [ ] Creating a new package
- [ ] Splitting an existing package
- [ ] Merging packages
- [ ] Other architectural change

## Alignment with Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
[How does this decision ensure each package has one clear purpose?]

### 2. Stable Dependencies
[How does this maintain the principle that stable packages shouldn't depend on unstable ones?]

### 3. Common Closure
[How does this keep things that change together in the same package?]

### 4. Common Reuse
[How does this ensure packages are reused as a whole?]

### 5. Acyclic Dependencies
[How does this avoid circular dependencies?]

### 6. Interface Segregation
[How does this ensure clients aren't forced to depend on interfaces they don't use?]

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Creating testing Package

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Author:** Team Lead  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Package(s):** testing (new)

**Decision:** Create a new testing package to consolidate all testing utilities and infrastructure.

**Context:** Testing utilities are currently duplicated across packages, leading to inconsistency and maintenance overhead.

**Decision Type:** âœ“ Creating a new package

**Alignment with Principles:**
1. **Single Responsibility:** The package has one clear purpose - providing testing utilities
2. **Stable Dependencies:** Testing package only depends on stable testing frameworks
3. **Common Closure:** All testing utilities change for similar reasons
4. **Common Reuse:** Test utilities are always used together
5. **Acyclic Dependencies:** No circular dependencies as testing is a leaf node
6. **Interface Segregation:** Separate exports for unit, integration, and e2e testing needs

### Example 2: Splitting Authentication from Core

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Author:** Architecture Team  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Package(s):** core (existing), auth (new)

**Decision:** Split authentication logic from core into a dedicated auth package.

**Context:** The core package has grown to include authentication logic that changes frequently and independently from other core utilities.
