# Cache Package Integration Complete

## Summary

Successfully updated markdown-compiler to use the shared cache package, eliminating code duplication and enabling consistent caching across projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Added `cache` package as a dependency
- Removed local cache implementation

### 2. Code Updates
- Updated imports in `NodeFileSystem.ts` and `MarkdownProcessor.ts`
- Removed `src/core/decorators/cache.ts` 
- Updated `src/index.ts` to remove cache decorator exports

### 3. Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Added new integration tests to verify caching behavior
- Cache keys remain compatible (custom keys still work)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reuse**: Eliminated ~100 lines of duplicate code
2. **Consistency**: Both projects now use identical caching logic
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for cache implementation
4. **Features**: markdown-compiler gains event emission for free

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing cache decorators continue to work
- Custom cache keys are preserved
- No breaking changes to the API
- TTL and other options work identically

## Integration Pattern

```typescript
// Before: Internal implementation
import { Cacheable } from '../../core/decorators/cache';

// After: Shared package
import { Cacheable } from 'cache';
```

## Next Steps Completed

✅ Updated markdown-compiler to use cache package
✅ Removed duplicate cache implementation  
✅ Verified all tests pass
✅ Added integration tests
✅ Committed and pushed changes

The cache package integration demonstrates the value of the decomposition strategy - shared functionality can be extracted and reused across multiple projects while maintaining backward compatibility.
