# Template Updates Summary

## Overview

All package templates and documentation have been updated to incorporate the decomposition findings and emphasize small, focused packages.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/docs/claude-md-template.md`
**Key Changes:**
- Added package size and complexity metrics
- Introduced "Single Responsibility" section
- Limited dependencies to 2-3 max
- Simplified code organization (one interface, one implementation)
- Added "Decomposition Guidelines" section with warning signs
- Updated development questions to focus on package size

### 2. `/docs/testing-package-implementation.md`
**Key Changes:**
- Added critical update that @h1b/testing is too big
- Split into 5 focused packages:
  - @h1b/test-container (~200 lines)
  - @h1b/mock-logger (~150 lines)
  - @h1b/mock-fs (~300 lines)
  - @h1b/test-fixtures (~200 lines)
  - @h1b/test-utils (~150 lines)
- Each package has one clear responsibility

### 3. `/docs/package-creation-checklist.md`
**Key Changes:**
- Pre-creation planning emphasizes single responsibility
- Added "<500 lines target" requirement
- Added "STOP" checkpoint to consider splitting
- Updated common mistakes to prioritize package size issues
- Success criteria now includes size and simplicity metrics

### 4. `/docs/migration-plan.md`
**Key Changes:**
- Added critical update about splitting @h1b/testing
- Listed the 5 smaller packages with size estimates
- Emphasized single responsibility principle

### 5. `/docs/shared-packages-guide.md`
**Key Changes:**
- Added "Package Design Principles" section
- Provided two package structure options (small preferred)
- Included good vs bad package examples
- Updated available packages to show decomposed testing packages
- Added size estimates for all packages

## Key Principles Embedded

1. **Small is Beautiful**: <500 lines per package
2. **Single Responsibility**: One package, one job
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: 2-3 maximum
4. **Quick Understanding**: 5-minute rule
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit "NOT responsible for" sections
6. **Flat Structure**: Avoid deep hierarchies
7. **Specific Naming**: No vague "utils" or "core" packages

## Impact

These updates ensure that:
- New packages will be small and focused
- Claude Code will have clear context for each package
- Developers will create more maintainable code
- The monorepo will scale better
- Testing will be simpler
- Code reuse will be more effective

## Next Steps

1. Start implementing the decomposed testing packages
2. Review existing packages for potential splits
3. Apply these principles to all future development
4. Monitor package sizes and split when needed
